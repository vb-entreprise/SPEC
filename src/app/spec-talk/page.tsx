              <p>
                As we know education reform, like other forms of social change, is a process. The world around us is changing fast in every sector as competition has increased in the 21st century. This advancement is both a result of the constant change and upgrading which, in turn, requires constant change and upgrading in everything around. For, it is in the law of nature to change. History takes note of the fact that the way we educate our young learners has evolved in India through Vedic times to the present knowledge era. This process has been gradual though steady over time. Our perceptions about the purpose of education have changed.
              </p>
              <p>
                A person aiming for a promising future, irrespective of sector, needs to equip him/herself with communicative language ability, critical thinking, problem solving skills etc. The way we educate our youth needs to change from the compulsion of rote learning to analysis and interpretation.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this emerging need of skills training among young learners of the nation, SPEC has founded Skills Development Cell with an aim to train students of constituent colleges of SPEC in various employability skills and make them industry-ready. Training in employability skills would help students earn healthy employment and make them able to be self-employed as well.
